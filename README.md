# CalculatorChallenge-Core-Data



- it is a calculator that should have two screens;

- the first must contain two fields for typing (ValueA and ValueB);

- still on this screen, we should have buttons that represent each mathematical operation;

- when the user clicks on one of the operations, the ValueA and ValueB fields must be validated so that they are valid for performing the mathematical operation;

- If the data is ok, then the following data should be recorded in a table or file:

A. ID: A sequential number, each new recorded record must have a new ID;

B. Value A: the entered ValueA;

C. B value: similar to the one above;

D. Operation: something that indicates which mathematical operation was performed;

E. Result: the result of the mathematical operation performed;

F. Date/Time: the date and time when the mathematical operation was performed;
